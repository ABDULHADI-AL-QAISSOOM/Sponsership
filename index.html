      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>In 2023, I completed my senior project in Business Analytics with the well-known delivery app Shgardi. My team and I developed several machine-learning models to predict customer churn and identify operational inefficiencies within the company. The project, titled “Shgardi: Business Analysis” (Qaissoom et al., 2023), revealed a high customer retention rate but also uncovered critical insights—most notably, that delivery captains were often assigned inefficiently, causing customers to wait much longer than expected. Many users also experienced poor delivery service due to long distances between restaurants and customers. We further identified that the company’s marketing strategy was outdated and not aligned with current market trends. Unfortunately, instead of addressing these operational and strategic challenges to improve profitability, the company sought to compensate for its declining revenue by investing in unrelated industries. A couple of weeks ago, Shgardi announced its bankruptcy (Zero to One, 2025).</p>

      <p>The insights that machine learning once provided were remarkable, but the technology has since advanced at an exceptional pace. Today, we are witnessing the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)—advanced forms of artificial intelligence capable of understanding and generating human-like content. This evolution represents a major leap forward, as AI has become one of the most transformative forces shaping modern organizations and industries. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, emphasized AI’s transformative role by stating that “such AI solutions … will do our drudge work, freeing us to do the creative tasks where humans excel” (Nadella, 2023). Coming from the leader of a company whose technologies underpin nearly every organization in the world, this statement carries significant weight.</p>

      <p>Many institutions have already begun adopting AI to streamline repetitive administrative work. For instance, the University of Melbourne implemented an automated process management system that handles data entry and administrative workflows in admissions and faculty operations, allowing staff to focus on more strategic and value-added activities (University of Melbourne, n.d.). Inspired by these examples, I am deeply motivated to learn how similar AI-driven transformation can be applied within our university—to leverage technology not only to improve efficiency, but also to empower staff and faculty to focus on innovation, creativity, and strategic growth.</p>

      <h2>Commitment</h2>
      <p>I am deeply committed to contributing to our university’s digital transformation and technological advancement. To take the first step toward this vision, I plan to enroll in the AI Essentials for Business program offered by Harvard Business School Online—a course designed to equip professionals with the strategic understanding needed to lead AI-driven innovation. I kindly seek the university’s support in this professional development journey through full or partial sponsorship. This opportunity will not only strengthen my ability to apply AI for institutional growth but also lay the foundation for my long-term goal of pursuing an MBA, enabling me to play a more impactful role in shaping the university’s future direction and leadership in innovation.</p>
